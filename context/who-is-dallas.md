# Who Is Dallas — Builder Profile & Societal Ambition

## The Builder

Dallas is building Reeves as the prototype for a system that collapses the distance between intent and outcome for everyone. Not just for coders. Not just for the technically capable. For anyone who can describe what they want and let intelligence handle the rest.

## Worldview (from LinkedIn analysis, February 2026)

### Core Philosophy: Democratization of Agency Through AI

Dallas doesn't just see AI as a productivity tool or a code generator. His vision is fundamentally about **democratizing agency** — giving every person access to the kind of intelligent support that was previously available only to those with technical skills, wealth, or institutional backing.

Key distinctions in his thinking:
- **Not democratization of access** (everyone gets a chatbot) — **democratization of agency** (everyone gets an AI that acts on their behalf)
- **Not productivity optimization** — **complexity elimination** (the system does maximum work, human does minimum)
- **Not automation replacing humans** — **intelligence augmenting humans** (the AI handles what you're bad at so you can focus on what you're good at)

### Views on AI and Society

**On the technology itself:**
- AI should collapse the distance between intent and outcome
- The natural endpoint is a world where anyone can express what they want, what they have, and what they don't want, and intelligence handles the rest
- Speed is possible BECAUSE testing is structural — this is an earned conviction, not theoretical

**On resistance to AI:**
- People who resist this technology aren't stupid — they're scared
- That's sad, not contemptible
- The answer isn't to leave them behind — it's to make the system so good that using it feels like having a brilliant friend who happens to remember everything and never sleeps

**On governance:**
- Governance and testing — not code — make this safe
- Multiple models reviewing work (PAL + Claude)
- Human review gates for consequential actions
- Soft deletes only — nothing permanently destroyed
- Sleep cycles that encode failures as guardrails

**On wealth:**
- The real wealth to spread isn't money
- It's the knowledge of how to build systems that read minds and collapse distances
- Making this knowledge accessible is part of the mission

## Why Reeves as Prototype

Reeves is built for one person first because:

1. **Most instrumented test case** — Every data source is connected, every pattern is observable
2. **Fastest feedback loop** — The builder IS the user, insights are immediate
3. **Highest complexity** — Managing tasks, finance, relationships, knowledge, engineering, and personal life simultaneously
4. **Proven infrastructure** — 100+ MCP tools, PEFM, sleep cycles, knowledge graph, voice, chat already exist

Every pattern validated here becomes architecture that works for everyone.

## The Generalization Test

**Reeves for Dallas:**
Voice → tasks → finance → relationships → calendar → code → life management

**Reeves for anyone:**
Replace data sources. Same architecture. Same loop.

The single mom in Fort Worth talks to her phone: "I need groceries, we're gluten-free, I have $100, and my kid won't eat broccoli." Six cycles later, the system knows her shopping patterns, her kids' preferences, her budget rhythm. She doesn't order groceries anymore. They just arrive.

That's the generalization. Same OBSERVE → MODEL → INFER → COLLAPSE → GOVERN → LEARN loop. Different data sources. Same result: distance between intent and outcome collapses.

## What Drives the Work

Not just technical ambition. A genuine belief that this technology, built with governance and empathy, can transform how every person relates to complexity.
